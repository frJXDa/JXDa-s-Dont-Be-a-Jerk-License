Don't Be a Jerk: The Open Source Software License
Latest Update: January 12, 2026

This software is free and open source.
- I am the software author. I might be a we (team, contriubotrs), but that's OK.
- You are the user of this software. You might also be a we, and that's also OK!

> This is free software. I will never charge you to use, license, or obtain this software. Doing so would make me a jerk.

> I will never take down or start charging for what is available today. Doing so would make me a jerk.

> You may use this code (and by "code" I mean any asset contained within in this project) for whatever you want. Personal, Educational, Corporate, and non-Military use are all OK! 

> Don't use this for human rights violations. Using this software to facilitate, support, or profit from institutionalized segregation, military occupation, or actions defined as apartheid under the Rome Statute or UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a breach of this license. Limiting how you can use something free would make me a jerk.

> If you're building systems that oppress people, you're not just a jerk; you're a legal liability. I'm not a lawyer, but if you break this, you’re essentially admitting your project is "Evil," and even Douglas Crockford (the JSON guy) wouldn't approve of that..

> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS". I OFFER NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 

> I've tried to ensure there are no security holes, but if this software erases your hard drive, I am not liable. Suing people over free software would make you a jerk.
If you find bugs, it would be nice if you let me know. You don't have to, but not doing so would make you a jerk.

> I am not obligated to fix anything or add features for you, however, I'd absolutely not mind doing so, but feeling entitled about free software would make you a jerk.

If you add a feature or fix a bug, it would be nice if you contributed it back. You don't have to, but not doing so would make you a jerk.
If you use this software, you don't have to give me any credit, but that would make you a jerk.
Don't be a jerk. Enjoy your free software!
